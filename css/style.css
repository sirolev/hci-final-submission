    Responses to questions from requirment 2 and 3
    -------------------------------------------------------

    How did you decide on your siteâ€™s color scheme?
    -------
        Partially inspired by the website whos layout I was refercing when designing mine.
        Partially dervived from testing out different colors to find what looks good.
        I also like the white/gray/blue pallet, as it looks professional and not overbearing.
        I choose to also include a little red because the icon I found has red, and it added some spice to the look.


    Provide me with the color palette you will use within your site and provide the hexadecimals values for each color.
    -------
        My pallete mostly consists of monochromatic blue and gray colors, and a little red.
        dark gray (heading text): #242424
        light gray (hr and text): #E6E6E6
        light gray (hr): #cecece 
        light gray (text): #929292
        blue (certain links): #0055FF
        pale gray/blue (text background and placeholders): #F6F7FC
        dark blue (footer background): #25253D
        white (text and background): #25253D
        opaque white (text): #ffffffb0
        medium gray (header text/icons): #707070
        medium gray/blue (login button): #7C889B
        opaque black (box shadow: #00000014;
        red/color (ranked section title background): #E37878


    What areas of your site will be impacted by your color choice?.
    -------
        I think all areas of the website are impacted by my color choices, and I listed how each color is used in my previous response


    What font(s) will you use for the <body>, <p> and <h1> - <h6> HTML tags? .
    -------
        I used the same font across the entire page, which was "Segoe UI".

    
    What are the different weights and sizes of the heading and paragraph tags?
    -------
        For headings, I typically used weight 600 which is semibold. For text, I mostly left it the default weight (normal).
        For the main section headings, I used font size 27px.
        For book titles I used font size 15px.
        For many <a> tags, like the links in the header or in the footer, I used font size 16px.
        For a couple large paragraphs in the featured highlight, I used font size 11px.
        For the text specifing the book genre, I used font size 12px.


    What is your desired line-height, word-spacing, and letter-spacing?
    -------
        I didn't modify any of these as I haven't had a need too.
